This file is to be paired with php_exploit.py

First I set up the virtual machine and configured the network settings between the host and VM
Next I needed to find the urls to connect to (I don't know it wasn't just added to the default page like a normal website)
I found the url  IP:8015

I choose to exploit the upload.php file
by inputing a php file I could then navigate to in the uploads folder to run a command that prints the contents of /etc/passwd

This is a simple error the upload system should check the names of the files and only allow safe extensions
